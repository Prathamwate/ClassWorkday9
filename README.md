# DOM Manipulation Dropdowns for Div Properties

This repository contains a simple web page that demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation using JavaScript to change various properties of a `div` element.

## How It Works

- The web page has 5 dropdowns, each representing a property of the `div` element that can be changed: color, background color, padding, font size, and font weight.
- When a user selects an option from any of the dropdowns, the corresponding JavaScript function is called.
- The JavaScript function updates the CSS styles of the `div` element based on the user's selection.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing basic styles for the page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the functions for property manipulation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/assignment-dom-dropdowns.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use the dropdowns to select different property values and observe the changes in the `div` element.

Feel free to explore the code to understand how DOM manipulation is achieved using JavaScript.
